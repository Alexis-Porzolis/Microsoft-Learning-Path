        "We've learned that models are computer code that processes information to make a prediction or a decision. Here, we'll train a model to guess a comfortable boot size for a dog, based on the size of the harness that fits them.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the examples below, there is no need to edit any code. Try to read it, understand it, then press the run button to run it. As always with these notebooks, it is vitally important that these code blocks are run in the correct order, and nothing is missed.\n",
        "\n",
        "> **Note**: If you've never used the Jupyter Notebooks environment before, there are a few things you should be aware of:\n",
        "> \n",
        "> - Notebooks are made up of *cells*. Some cells (like this one) contain *markdown* text, while others (like the one beneath this one) contain code.\n",
        "> - You can run each code cell by using the **&#9658; Run** button. the **&#9658; Run** button will show up when you hover over the cell.\n",
        "> - The output from each code cell will be displayed immediately below the cell.\n",
        "> - Even though the code cells can be run individually, some variables used in the code are global to the notebook. That means that you should run all of the code cells <u>**in order**</u>. There may be dependencies between code cells, so if you skip a cell, subsequent cells might not run correctly.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Preparing data\n",
        "\n",
        "The first thing we do with a model is load data. We'll cover this in more detail in a later exercise. For now, we'll just write our data directly in our code. Review and run the following code to get started:\n"
